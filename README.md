## Overview

Publisher Media Kit provides a quick and easy option for small to medium sized publishers to digitize their media kit.  If you are a publisher hoping for a page like the [NY Times' Advertising Standard Units](https://nytmediakit.com/standard-units), but do not have a designer or developer on staff?  Then this plugin is for you.  If you are still using a print or PDF version of your media kit to sell space on your website, but want show advertisers looking to buy digital real estate that you are a digital-forward partner?  Then this plugin is for you.

The plugin adds a new "Media Kit" page, block patterns, and placeholder content that can then be customized to fit your need (e.g., text, links, colors, images, adding page link to site footer).

## Support Level

**Stable:** 10up is not planning to develop any new features for this, but will still respond to bug reports and security concerns. We welcome PRs, but any that include new features should be small and easy to integrate and should not include breaking changes. We otherwise intend to keep this tested up to the most recent version of WordPress.
