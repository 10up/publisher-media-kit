Pre-configured Media Kit Page using Gutenberg Block Patterns.

== Description ==

Publisher Media Kit provides a quick and easy option for small to medium sized publishers to digitize their media kit.  If you are a publisher hoping for a page like the [NY Times' Advertising Standard Units](https://nytmediakit.com/standard-units), but do not have a designer or developer on staff?  Then this plugin is for you.  If you are still using a print or PDF version of your media kit to sell space on your website, but want show advertisers looking to buy digital real estate that you are a digital-forward partner?  Then this plugin is for you.

The plugin adds a new "Media Kit" page, block patterns, and placeholder content that can then be customized to fit your need (e.g., text, links, colors, images, adding page link to site footer).

== Screenshots ==
