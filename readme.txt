Pre-configured Media Kit Page using Gutenberg Block Patterns.

== Description ==

Publisher Media Kit provides a quick and easy option for small to medium sized publishers to digitize their media kit.  If you are a publisher hoping for a page like the [NY Times' Advertising Standard Units](https://nytmediakit.com/standard-units), but do not have a designer or developer on staff?  Then this plugin is for you.  If you are still using a print or PDF version of your media kit to sell space on your website, but want show advertisers looking to buy digital real estate that you are a digital-forward partner?  Then this plugin is for you.

The plugin adds a new "Media Kit" page, block patterns, and placeholder content that can then be customized to fit your need (e.g., text, links, colors, images, adding page link to site footer).

== Theme Compatibility ==

We have tested the plugin with the following WordPress themes and have validated that the resulting `Media Kit` page renders as expected on the front-end and within the block editor.  Please [open an issue](https://github.com/10up/publisher-media-kit/issues/new/choose) if you find an issue with any of these themes or have an alternate, public theme with a conflict that we can help resolve.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do you require WordPress 5.5 and above?  Why not 5.0 and above? =

We require WordPress 5.5 and above as this is when `register_block_pattern_category` function introduced to register Block Patterns Categories in WordPress core and it is used in the Publisher Media Kit plugin.  In fact, we recommend that you utilize the latest major version of WordPress and commit to testing and ensuring that Publisher Media Kit works on the latest WordPress version.
